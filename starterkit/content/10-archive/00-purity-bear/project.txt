Day of Purity is a cause that encourages youth to remain sexually pure, talk about a difficult task. They needed to get attention on a $0 budget. I made a video that went viral. It got 250,000 views in a week and was posted on blogs like <a href="http://tosh.comedycentral.com/blog/2012/01/19/meet-the-purity-bear/" target="_blank">Tosh.0</a>, <a href="http://jezebel.com/5877300/the-purity-bear-will-cockblock-you-until-youre-married" target="_blank">Jezebel</a>, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/emma-gray/purity-bear-abstinence-virginity-pledge_b_1229069.html" target="_blank">Huffington Post</a> and <a href="http://www.adweek.com/adfreak/save-yourself-marriage-help-purity-bear-137647" target="_blank">Adweek</a>. You have to start the conversation somewhere.
