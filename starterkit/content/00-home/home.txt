Text: People call me a lot of things: Kegs, Shawnee, Shawnathan, and most commonly, CagleBagle. I don't mind going by different names or even different titles. I’m a flexible creative communicator with design, advertising, and media skills. I have worked with big brands and CEO’s of 10 person companies. I prides myself on my cultural awareness, methodical work ethic, and surname ryhmability.
